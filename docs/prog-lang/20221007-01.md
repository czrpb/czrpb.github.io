# What does the capture operator do?

Subtitled: **What is a closure?**

## TL-DR

The capture operator (`&`) creates a closure which is a function bound to a scope with the purpose of accessing the bindings in said scope.

## Post

Uh, ok, the *TL-DR* is totally unintelligble!

Hey, but lets go thru it step-by-step:

The capture operator (`&`) creates a closure?

Hmm, ok, but what is a closure? A closure is a function bound to a scope.

Hmm, ok, but what then is a scope? A scope is a set of bindings.

Hmm, ok, but what then is a binding? A binding is an association between a symbol/name and a value.

**Ah**, ok! So, this we know:

```elixir
x = 4
```

The symbol `x` is *bound* to the value `4`.

Ok, so now back to the previous question: What creates a set of bindings (a scope)? Functions!

```elixir
defmodule SomeModule do

  def scope(args) do
    <  A SCOPE WITH SOME BINDING IS HERE!!!  >
  end

end
```

Ok, so a closure is a function bound to a scope? So, how do I create a function bound to this scope or `scope`'s scope?

Easy! If functions create scopes, then lets do this:

```elixir
defmodule SomeModule do

  def scope(x) do
    <  A SCOPE WITH SOME BINDING IS HERE!!!  >
    def closure(y) do
      <  WHOA! ANOTHER SCOPE WITH SOME BINDING IS HERE!!!  >
    end
  end

end
```

Except we cant do this:

```elixir
iex> defmodule Test do
...>   def closure(x) do
...>     def internal_function(y) do
...>       x + y
...>     end
...>   end
...> end

```

### Diversion: Other Languages

We can do this in other languages, so lets take 2:

#### Python

A function in python looks like:

```python
def scope(x):
  . . .  BODY  . . .
```

And you can define functions within functions:

```python
def scope(x):

    def closure(y):
      . . .  BODY  . . .

```

#### Javascript

A function in javascript looks like:

```javascript
function scope(x) {
  . . .  BODY  . . .
}
```

And you can define functions within functions:

```javascript
function scope(x) {

  function closure(y) {
    . . .  BODY  . . .
  }

}
```

### Return: Diversion

Ok, so, we cant create closures in Elix ... wait! Is this the only way we can create
a function?

Nope! `fn ... -> ... end`

So, can we do this?

```elixir
defmodule SomeModule do

  def scope(x) do

    closure = fn y -> . . . end

  end

end
```

Awesome! So, I have a function in a scope, thus I have a closure!

Lets make sure we understand though:

> We have the function `closure` which is bound to `scope`'s scope.

But, what does that do for me? Maybe the question is what does or can the function
`closure` do with `scope`'s scope?

If a scope is a set of bindings, maybe `closure` can use some of `scope`'s bindings?

And what are some of `scope`'s bindings?

```elixir
defmodule SomeModule do

  def scope(x) do

    closure = fn y -> . . . end

  end

end
```

What symbols are bound in `scope`'s scope? There is only one and it is `scope`'s
parameter `x`! The symbol `x` is bound to whatever value `scope` is called with; for
example `x` is bound to `4` in this call:

```elixir
SomeModule.scope(4)
```

So, if the function has access to `scope`'s bindings, this means we can do:

```elixir
defmodule SomeModule do

  def scope(x) do

    closure = fn y -> x + y end

  end

end
```

The function creates it own scope and has a binding of the parameter `y`, and
it uses the `x` from `scope`'s scope.

When I then call `scope` I get back the function `closure`:

```elixir
iex> SomeModule.scope(4)
#Function<0.38700837/1 in SomeModule.scope/1>
```

What does this function/closure do? Given we passed `4`, `x` is bound to `4`
and when the function/closure executes it will add `4` to whatever it is called
with:

```elixir
iex> add4.(13)
17
```

And how is this useful? Say i want to return a list where each element is incremented
by `4`:

```elixir
iex> Enum.map(0..5, add4)
[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

> Write functions, which take function, to achieve the data transformations you desire.


### Conclusion

The `&` operator *captures* the scope of the function in which it used, making it available
to the resulant function created by `&`.

### Closures in Other Langauges

I wont write much description here, just give examples in Python and Javascript.

#### Python

```python
>>> def scope(x):
...   def closure(y):
...     return x + y
...   return closure
...
>>> add4 = scope(4)
>>> add4(13)
17
>>> [add4(i) for i in range(6)]
[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

#### Javascript

```javascript
> function scope(x) {
...   function closure(y) {
...     return x + y;
...   }
...   return closure;
... }
undefined
> add4 = scope(4)
[Function: closure]
> add4(13)
17
```

I dont know the (list) comprehension syntax for javascript, anyone?
