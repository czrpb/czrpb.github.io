# What does the capture operator do?

Subtitled: **What is a closure?**

## TL-DR

The capture operator (`&`) creates a closure which is a function bound to a scope with the purpose of accessing the bindings in said scope.

## Post

Uh, ok, the *TL-DR* is totally unintelligble!

Hey, but lets go thru it step-by-step:

The capture operator (`&`) creates a closure?

Hmm, ok, but what is a closure? A closure is a function bound to a scope.

Hmm, ok, but what then is a scope? A scope is a set of bindings.

Hmm, ok, but what then is a binding? A binding is an association between a symbol/name and a value.

**Ah**, ok! So, this we know:

```elixir
x = 4
```

The symbol `x` is *bound* to the value `4`.

Ok, so now back to the previous question: What creates a set of bindings (a scope)? Functions!

```elixir
defmodule SomeModule do
     .  .  .
  def some_scope(args) do
    <  A SCOPE WITH SOME BINDING IS HERE!!!  >
  end
     .  .  .
end
```

Ok, so a closure is a function bound to a scope? So, how do I create a function bound to this scope or `some_scope`'s scope?

Easy! If functions create scopes, then lets do this:

```elixir
defmodule SomeModule do
     .  .  .
  def some_scope(x) do
    <  A SCOPE WITH SOME BINDING IS HERE!!!  >
    def a_function_bound_to_somescopes_scope(y) do
      <  WHOA! ANOTHER SCOPE WITH SOME BINDING IS HERE!!!  >
    end
  end
     .  .  .
end
```

Except we cant do this:

```elixir
iex> defmodule Test do
...>   def closure(x) do
...>     def internal_function(y) do
...>       x + y
...>     end
...>   end
...> end

### Diversion: Other Languages

We can do this in other languages, so lets take 2:

#### Python

A function in python looks like:

```python
def some_scope(x):
  . . .  BODY  . . .
```

And you can define functions within functions:

```python
def some_scope(x):
    . . .
    def a_function_bound_to_somescopes_scope(y):
      . . .  BODY  . . .
    . . .
```

#### Javascript

A function in javascript looks like:

```javascript
function some_scope(x) {
  . . .  BODY  . . .
}
```

And you can define functions within functions:

```javascript
function some_scope(x) {
  . . .
  function a_function_bound_to_somescopes_scope(y) {
    . . .  BODY  . . .
  }
  . . .
}
```

### Return from Diversion

So, we cant create closures in Elix ... wait! Is this the only way we can create a function?

Nope! `fn ... -> ... end`
