# Should I use the `&` operator as a shortcut for `fn arg -> expr end`?

## TLDR

Yes, yes you should learn and use this feature of Elixir.

## The Post

Brooklin Myers of DockYard is creating course material for the Elixir language:
[DockYard Academy](https://dockyard.com/blog/2022/07/26/what-to-expect-from-the-dockyard-academy-q-a-with-instructor-brooklin-myers).

In the deployment and use of the *beta* curriculum, there was a question about the
goodness of using `&` operator as a shortcut for creating anonymous functions.

The concern boils down to questioning the **readability**:

```elixir
Interactive Elixir (1.14.0) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(1)> (fn x -> x + 1 end).(10)
11
iex(2)> (& &1 + 1).(10)
11
```

### The Facts

Lets start with some facts about the `&` operator, with references:

* **Getting Started** guide on [Function capturing](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/modules-and-functions.html#function-capturing)
* **`&expr`** description in [`&expr`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.SpecialForms.html#&/1)
